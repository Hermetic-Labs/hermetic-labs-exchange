# ============================================
# Marketplace Packages (Source of Truth)
# ============================================
# The packages/ folder contains the source code for all marketplace packages.
# We DO want to track these in git as they are the single source of truth.
# However, build outputs go to dist/ which is already ignored.

# Ignore package node_modules (each package may have its own)
packages/**/node_modules/

# Ignore build artifacts within packages
packages/**/*.bundle.js
packages/**/*.bundle.js.map
packages/**/dist/

# ============================================
# Build Outputs (Generated - DO NOT COMMIT)
# ============================================
# These are generated by the build script and uploaded to Azure
/dist/bundles/
/dist/zips/

# Package zip files (deployed to Azure, not GitHub)
public/packages/*.zip

# Keep catalog.json tracked (it's the marketplace database for GitHub Pages fallback)
# !public/catalog.json
