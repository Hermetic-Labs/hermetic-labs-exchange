# Package Name - Python Dependencies
#
# List your Python package dependencies here (pip format).
# These are installed when the package is set up.
#
# Guidelines:
# - Pin versions for production stability: package==1.2.3
# - Use ranges for flexibility: package>=1.2,<2.0
# - Keep minimal - reuse EVE OS core dependencies when possible
#
# Core dependencies already available from EVE OS:
# - fastapi
# - pydantic
# - httpx
# - sqlalchemy

# Add your package-specific dependencies below:
# example-package>=1.0.0
