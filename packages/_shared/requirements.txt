# EVE-OS Marketplace - Shared Plugin Dependencies
#
# These are the common dependencies that marketplace backend plugins use.
# When a package is installed into the main codebase, these are checked
# against the main backend's requirements and installed if missing.
#
# This file is for:
# 1. IDE/linting - so Pylance knows what's available
# 2. Cloud marketplace API - runs its own FastAPI service
# 3. Dependency resolution - installer checks these
